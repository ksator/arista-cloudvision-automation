# About the tools used in this repository

- **cURL** is a command-line tool for getting or sending data using URLs
- **Wget** is a program that retrieves content from web servers
- **Postman** can be used to explore and test REST APIs and gRPC services
- **Python** with the following modules:
  - The **requests** library can be used for making HTTP requests in Python
  - The **cvprac** python library can be used to manage CVP. cvprac is written using CVP REST APIs an CVP resource APIs
  - The **pyGNMI** library is a gNMI client
- **gNMIc** is a command-line gNMI client
- **gnmi** is a command-line gNMI client
- **pygnmicli** is a command-line gNMI client
- **pyang** can be used to generate a tree representation of YANG models for quick visualization
- **gRPCurl** is a command-line tool that lets you interact with gRPC servers. It's basically curl for gRPC servers  

# Requirements

- CVP APIs require [token based authentication](Token_based_authentication).  
- [RESTCONF](RESTCONF) and [gNMI](gNMI) require to configure the devices to stream [OpenConfig](OpenConfig) data to CVP.  
- Configuring the devices to stream [OpenConfig](OpenConfig) data to CVP requires to use [certificate based authentication](Certificate_based_authentication/) (for devices and CVP communication).
